# Authentication Issues Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem: Automatic Logouts

### What was happening:
- Users were being automatically logged out due to Supabase authentication fetch failures
- Network errors in middleware were causing unnecessary redirects to login page
- Temporary network issues were treated as authentication failures

### Root Causes Identified:
1. **Middleware Configuration**: Using browser client instead of server client in middleware
2. **Network Error Handling**: Fetch failures causing immediate logout redirects
3. **Missing Retry Logic**: No retry mechanism for temporary network issues
4. **Timeout Issues**: Default timeouts too aggressive for network conditions

### Fixes Applied:

#### 1. Enhanced Middleware (`utils/supabase/middleware.ts`)
- ✅ Added proper error handling for network issues
- ✅ Implemented retry logic with `withAuthRetry()`
- ✅ Distinguished between network errors and authentication errors
- ✅ Added fallback behavior to prevent unnecessary logouts

#### 2. Improved Client Configuration (`lib/supabase-config.ts`)
- ✅ Added custom fetch configuration with timeouts
- ✅ Implemented retry logic for failed requests
- ✅ Added proper error handling for network issues
- ✅ Set appropriate timeouts (15s client, 10s server)

#### 3. Enhanced Authentication Wrapper (`utils/api/authWrapper.ts`)
- ✅ Added network error detection
- ✅ Return 503 (Service Unavailable) for network issues instead of 401
- ✅ Proper error classification

#### 4. Improved Auth Hook (`hooks/useAuth.ts`)
- ✅ Better session error handling
- ✅ Prevent automatic logout on temporary network issues
- ✅ Only clear user state for actual authentication errors

#### 5. Server Client Updates
- ✅ Fixed admin middleware to use server client
- ✅ Added proper session error handling
- ✅ Improved role-based access checks

### Testing the Fixes:

1. **Monitor Console Logs**: Look for these improvements:
   ```
   ✅ "Network error in Supabase fetch" warnings instead of immediate logouts
   ✅ "Retry attempt X/Y" messages showing retry logic working
   ✅ Users staying logged in during temporary network issues
   ```

2. **Simulate Network Issues**: 
   - Temporarily disconnect internet while logged in
   - User should remain logged in when connection returns
   - No automatic redirects to login page

3. **Check Error Handling**:
   - Network errors should show user-friendly messages
   - Real authentication errors should still properly log out
   - API calls should return 503 for network issues, 401 for auth issues

### If Issues Persist:

1. **Check Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key
   ```

2. **Verify Network Configuration**:
   - Check if Supabase URL is accessible
   - Verify no firewall blocking requests
   - Test direct Supabase connectivity

3. **Monitor Browser Network Tab**:
   - Look for failed requests to Supabase
   - Check for CORS issues
   - Verify response times

4. **Enable Debug Logging**:
   ```typescript
   // Add to your client code for debugging
   console.log('Auth state:', { user, loading })
   ```

### Prevention Measures:

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Set up alerts for authentication errors
2. **Network Resilience**: The retry logic should handle most network issues
3. **User Experience**: Users will see loading states instead of sudden logouts
4. **Error Reporting**: Network issues are logged but don't cause logouts

### Additional Recommendations:

1. **Consider using a service worker** for offline support
2. **Implement connection status monitoring** in the UI
3. **Add user notifications** for network issues
4. **Set up monitoring** for authentication failure rates

The authentication system should now be much more resilient to network issues and provide a better user experience.
